# Reflection:
I'm definitely a lot more confident with webpack then when I was learning it prior to the project. I also had a lot of fun doing exporting and importing with modules. There were a few times that I had to rewrite some of my code because of a hiccup but for the most part I found it to be smooth sailing. This project was a learning experience and I'm glad I went through any troubles because it for sure will make me a better programmer.
